## Preview: https://animate-on-scroll.netlify.app/

Building something that when scrolling down for the first time does:
- Fades in elements in view in a staggered fashion detected by IntersectionObserver
- Detects whether a section has a dark BG or light and changes global styles accordingly
- Ensures that on scroll up it doesn't animate again
